# ripper
Tumblr ripper script to get all the images on a specific tumblr blog.

just place the script file where you like and then open the terminal ( on mac or linux) or the command prompt (on windows) and run:

python3 ripper.py http://some-tumblr-blog.tumblr.com

the first part is the python 3 interpretter ("python3") call

we will use it to run the "ripper.py" script

and then we will pass the tumblr blog url as a parameter to the script

this script will download the following image formats ( jpg|png|gif|jpeg|jpg-large|jpeg-large )
